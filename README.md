# Blender-IcicleGenerator

Add-on to make icicles on (almost) any mesh in Blender!

For the plugin to work, you need to have a mesh tracing out the path for the icicles to follow. Select the object, and run the script.

Icicles of various sizes are created to fill the length of each edge. Icicles will not be added to vertical edges.

New in v2.3, cones are subdivided, scaled and transformed to add random shaping for better-looking icicles.
